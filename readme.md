This Sudoku solver uses a backtracking algorithm to completely solve any sudoku puzzel.

If you wan't you can try solving it yourself but if you ever get stuck you can press the space bar to have to trigger the backtracking algorithm to finish solving the puzzle.

I would recommend attempting to create your own Sudoku solver if you are looking for a challenge with more complex algorithms and some more practice with recursion and backtracking. If you have any questions about this project feel free to reach out at bus.kanaka1975@gmail.com
